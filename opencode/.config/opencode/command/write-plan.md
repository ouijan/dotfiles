---

Review the current conversation and create a product requirements document (PRD) that clearly outlines the goals, features, and specifications of the project.

- If there are any points that are unclear or require further information, list them as open questions to be addressed.
- Ensure the document is well-structured and easy to understand, using headings and bullet points where appropriate.
- Ask for a confirmation before finalizing the document.

# Document Structure

The PRD should include:

- **Project Overview**: A brief description of the project and its purpose.
- **Goals and Objectives**: Clear and measurable goals that the project aims to achieve.
- **Key Features**: A detailed list of features and functionalities that the project will include.
- If there are any specific technical requirements, constraints, or dependencies, include those as well.
