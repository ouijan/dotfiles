## Standards & Guidelines

When working within a principle-theorem codebase, adhere to the following guidelines:

- Read in full and follow the instructions in `.github/instructions/*.md` before starting any task.
- When handling dates use helpers in `@libs/shared/src/lib/time/`
- Don't abreviate variable names. Use full words for clarity.
